**For articles like: "use [Model] in Claude Code", "[Model] in Cursor", "[Model] with OpenCode"**

## Sections (in this order)

1. **Quick Answer callout** — "Set 3 env vars → restart [Tool] → start coding with [Model]"

2. **Model Introduction** (brief: 2-3 sentences + benchmark table) — What the model is, key strengths for coding
   - 📌 From HF model card `--- Model ---`
   - 📌 Benchmarks from HF README (pick coding-relevant: SWE-bench, LiveCodeBench, Aider)

3. **Why [Tool] + [Model]** — What makes this combination valuable (1-2 paragraphs)

6. **Conclusion + FAQ + SEO Titles**

**STRICT SECTION RULES — Code Agent Integration articles ONLY contain these sections listed above.**

**DO NOT INCLUDE any of these sections — they belong to other article types:**
- ❌ "Which Deployment Method" / deployment comparison
- ❌ Provider pricing comparison tables (this is API Provider article territory)
- ❌ Local Deployment / GGUF Quantization (this is VRAM article territory)
- ❌ Cost Comparison: API vs Self-Hosted (this is VRAM/How to Access territory)
- ❌ "How to Access" via web/API/local (this is How to Access article territory)
- ❌ Fabricated tool-calling JSON schemas or API examples not from official docs
- ❌ Configuration parameters (temperature, top-p) that the tool does not support

The article focuses on ONE tool (the one in the keyword). Show ONLY how to set it up and use it effectively with the model.

## Thesis Template
